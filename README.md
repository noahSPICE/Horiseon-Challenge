# Code Refactor Starter Code

This is my first challenge for UCF Coding Bootcamp.

This refractor code is designed to have holes and areas of improvement that need to be added throughout the completion of the assignment.

This refractor will have areas of composition as well as comments stating what different changes are placed and the specific functions behind them.

This is all uploaded to my "Horison-Challenge" repo and posted as a website through Git Pages.

The original code came from this repo: git@github.com:coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram.git

And the updated code is found within this repo: git@github.com:noahSPICE/Horiseon-Challenge.git
in the docs folder.
